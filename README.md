# Compass Scholarship RESTful API

This project is a RESTful API built using  Spring Boot that uses standard HTTP operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to facilitate the management of the Compass Scholarship Program. Our main goal with this web service was to be able to register information for the classes of the program, and we achieved it by enabling several operations for students, classes, staff and squads.
